    body: "There are many amazing mods and overhauls that push the boundaries of what Ultimate is, so much so that it becomes extremely different from the base game. Ultimate 14 aims to be a 'Season 3' update for Ultimate. Most modern fighting games introduce new universal mechanics while rebalancing the cast, which is the aim of this mod. There won't be game-changing features like Wavedashing or Ledgehogging, but main features like Parrying and Ledgetrumping become even stronger with reinforced mechanics. Characters in 14 won't stray too far away from their 13.1 tier list placements, a part from decloned characters. This mod is also made with the intention that users can add their favorite standalone custom movesets, while still providing a substantial base for those that don't want more characters. Ultimate 14 is a simple mod that aims the enhance what the base game can offer competitively!"
