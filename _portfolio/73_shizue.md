# Overview 

Isabelle's aerials have been altered to help encourage her to move up close to the opponent, as opposed to Villager who enjoys camping behind trees.


# Changes

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Forward Air** | | Slings a massive wad of Bells for 12% damage, very similar to Villager's Axe but with more startup |
| **Back Air** | | Sweeps the air behind her for an 8.0% combo starter. This move has very little end lag and landing lag! |
| **Up Air** | | Pops her umbrella. Deals the same knockback as her original up air, but the hitbox is moved higher up. Once per air time, she'll be able to bounce upwards in the air |
| **Down Air** | | Pops her umbrella. Deals the same knockback as her original down air, but the hitbox is moved higher down. |
|  |  |  |
| **Down Special** | | Lloid's detection radius has been increased |
