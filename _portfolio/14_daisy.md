# Overview 

The princess of sarasaland and the queen of the court is much more different than her diplomatic mushroom kingdom counterpart, and as such a decent amount has been changed about Daisy. Most notably she cannot float, but comes with a uniquely short mini jump that acts similar to float cancelling. To compensate, some of her damage output and launch power has been decreased
