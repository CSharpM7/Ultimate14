# Overview 

The princess of sarasaland and the queen of the court is much more different than her diplomatic mushroom kingdom counterpart, and as such a decent amount has been changed about Daisy. Most notably she cannot float, but comes with a uniquely short mini jump that acts similar to float cancelling. To compensate, most of her damage output and recovery has been toned down.
