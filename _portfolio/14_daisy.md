# Overview 

The princess of sarasaland and the queen of the court is much more different than her diplomatic mushroom kingdom counterpart, and as such a lot has been changed about Daisy. She no longer has peach's float, but her uniquely small short hop still lets her perform aerials close to the ground. To compensate, Daisy's agility is improved, she has increased range on her forward air, she now has two spikes, and several other offensive tools have been given to her
