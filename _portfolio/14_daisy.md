# Overview 

The princess of sarasaland and the queen of the court is much more different than her diplomatic mushroom kingdom counterpart, and as such a decent amount has been changed about Daisy. As she is an echo of Peach, she has a new unique ability: Petal Dash. It's effectively the same as float, but you will be locked to moving forward for a short amount of time, similar to an airdash. Alongside this new movement option, Daisy's agility is improved, she has slightly increased range on her forward air, she now has a spike, and she has been given a unique counter projectile.
