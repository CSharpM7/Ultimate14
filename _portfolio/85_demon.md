# Overview 

This character was the result of crunch, which is a real shame. On paper,  this character is honestly decently designed to allow for some amazing player expression. Alas, put him alongside the rest of the cast of Ultimate, and that's when things look a bit fuzzy. These balance changes help to soothe over that extra bit of crunch, making Kazuya less "Luigi" and more "Sheik"
