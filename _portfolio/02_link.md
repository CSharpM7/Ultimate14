# Overview 

Link receives a redesigned moveset to match his redesigned look, giving him "DLC treatment". His defensive tools have been adjusted to be less extreme, while he now sports a Dash Attack that can be much more useful. His recovery no longer relies solely on Bomb Jumping as he has a few new tricks to make it back to the stage.

# Changes

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Dash Attack** | | Thrusts his shield forward for a Shield Bash. Similar to Palutena, his arm becomes invincible during the initial hitbox. |
|  |  |  |
| **Down Smash** | | The fabled Hero's Spin, though it has less rotations than it's original Up Special counterpart. It also contains a sourspot on Link's feet to still hit small opponents. |
|  |  |  |
| **Down Air** | | No longer pogos, but has a windbox that activates on landing |

## Up Special (Revali's Gale)

This up special will have Link rise into the air, then slowly decend down, similar to Game and Watch and Peach. On the ground, you can hold the special button to charge up, increasing your launch distance. In the air, you can cancel the move with an air dodge, special, or aerial.

## Shield Attack (Shield + Special)

Pressing the special button during shield lets Link do a quick shield attack, in reference to how his Shield Attack functions in his games. His arm is invincible during the active frames of the move. This gives Link a quick Out of Shield option that isn't as potent as his old Up Special

## Wall Climbing

<video src="https://csharpm7.github.io/Ultimate14/assets/img/videos/link_wall.mp4" width="640" height="360" controls></video>

Like in Breath of the Wild, Link can cling onto walls for a short period of time. Unlike Greninja, Bayonetta, and the other Wall Clingers, Link can move up and down during this state. Moving will deplete your stamina faster, and if you run out of stamina, you enter tumble fall. Make sure you make it back on stage to restore your stamina!
