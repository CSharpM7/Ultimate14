# Changes

| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Down Tilt** | | Hits the ground below him with his whip. The tipper can launch foes up and back, perfect to follow up with Up Air. |
|  |  |  |
| **Dash Attack** | | A charging tackle attack |
|  |  |  |
| **Down Air** | | Simliar to Up Air, strikes his whip downwards. This move can only spike opponents if it hits a grounded opponent, or if the whip does not touch the stage. This move also can't go through the stage (unlike how Sephiroth's can), but can go through platforms. |
