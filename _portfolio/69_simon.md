# Changes

| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Down Tilt** | | Hits the ground below him with his whip. The tipper can launch foes up and back, perfect to follow up with Up Air. Deals 10.0%/8.0%/2.0% |
|  |  |  |
| **Dash Attack** | | A charging tackle attack. The strong hit deals 12% while the weak hit deals 9.0% |
|  |  |  |
| **Down Air** | | Similar to Up Air, strikes his whip downwards. This move can only spike opponents if it hits a grounded opponent, or if the whip does not touch the stage. This move also can't go through the stage (unlike how Sephiroth's can), but can go through platforms. This move also cannot tether to the ledge. Deals the same damage as up air |
