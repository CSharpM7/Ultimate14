# Overview 

Lucina's massive change includes her lost Bow article over Side Special. Some of the rest of her kit is now replaced with the various Dancing Blade angles, which tones down some of her range while on the ground. Without the bow, she's mostly received nerfs but with it, she is a very strong all-around fighter
