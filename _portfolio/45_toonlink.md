# Overview 

Toon Link has already been made different than the other Links, though not by much. This patch gives him some unique properties to his specials.

# Changes

## Stats

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Run Speed** | | Decreased to 1.65 (similar to Olimar)  |
| **Jump Height** | | Decreased to 32 (similar to Charizard)  |


## Moveset

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Forward Tilt** | | Active frames reduced by 2 |
|  |  |  |
| **Forward Air** | | Startup increased to frame 17 |
|  |  |  |
| **Neutral Special** | | Reaching full charges transforms the arrow into a light arrow. Light Arrows travel 2.5x faster, aren't affected by gravity, and deal increased knockback! |
| **Up Special** | | Increased SDI multiplier |
|  |  | Reduced final hit KBG |
|  |  | Increased start up to 7 to match vanilla BotW Link |
|  |  |  |

## Side Special (Homing Boomerang)

As an homage to the Wind Waker, Toon Link can hold the special button to search for targets! Toon Link can only target opponents in front of him. Once an icon flashes over an opponent, the boomerang will lock on to their location for up to two seconds. If you don't want the boomerang to seek opponents, simply release the special button before frame 8 and it will act as normal. The boomerang is unaffected by flicking the stick, which means its damage output is relatively low.
