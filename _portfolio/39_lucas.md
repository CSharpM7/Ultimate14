# Overview 

Lucas' notable changes come with his new Neutral and Down Specials. Rather than pulling from Kumatora's ability pool, or borrowing from Ness', Lucas now has his unique PK Lifeup for healing himself AND allies, as well as PK Counter.

## Neutral Special: PK Lifeup

This move is dedicated towards either healing yourself, or your teammates in Team Battles! Enemies won't receive a heal, however they can interrupt your move. This move takes 30 seconds to recharge to full strength, but the move can still be used without being at full power. If you get interuptted before casting the attack, instead of being put at 100% cooldown, you will be put 50% closer to the full cooldown. This way, if you are interrupted while completely fresh, you'll have a 15 second cooldown, but if you are interrupted while 50% fresh, you'll have a ~23 second cooldown.

## Side Special: PK Fast-Flash

Lucas' PK Fire received a visual upgrade to look a little more like PK Flash. It still functions the same, though it deals electric damage instead of fire damage

## Down Special: PK Counter

Works exactly like the Fire Emblem counters, with a 1.3x multiplier. Lucas retains his unique momentum during this state.
