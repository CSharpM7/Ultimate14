# Overview 

Let's be honest, this is what you came here for. There might be quite a few changes here, but nothing that puts Steve out of the running for Top 5. The two biggest changes are to UpTilt and Weapon Hitboxes. UpTilt is made slower, so you can't just hold the A button. Its aerial counterpart acts more like its grounded variant, which means Up Tilt ladders end sooner. Weapon sourspots now no longer get upgraded alongside the current material. In practice, it won't change too much, but this does make it so Diamond Back Air's armpit hitbox won't kill until much later. Across the board, Steve has receieved slight damage reducations to account for Diamond tools. As a conselation prize, blocks now decay less when you stand on them, and they also decay less over time. Steve's up smash is also much safer to use.


# Changes

- For Uptilt/Upair,Fair and Bair: only the weapon's head uses the specific material hitboxes. The handles have the same properties as the wood variant. The handle hitbox sizes are also reduced, so that it is less likely to hit the sourspot of the move.

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Stats** | | Weight reduced (92->83) |
|  | |  |
| **Jab / Forward Tilt / Neutral Air / Short Hop Forward Air / Short Hop Back Air** | | Durability degradation increased (2->3) |
| | | Base knockback increased |
| | | First Active Frame increased |
| **Up Tilt / Up Air** | | Total frames increased (12->16 for gold, 16->22 for others). This adds 2 frames to startup. |
| | | Damage reduced by 1% |
|  |  |  |
| **Forward Smash** | | Damage reduced by 1.25% |
| **Up Smash** | | Up Smash has been reworked quite a bit, with Steve spawning the magma block before the move is chargeable. While charging, the magma block has a consistent hitbox (with increased SDI mutlipler, think similar to PK fire). This makes this move safer on whiff, but less potent on hit. |
| | | Launching hitbox removed |
| | | First active frame heavily reduced |
| | | Sourspot now exists when no pickaxe is equipped |
| | | Sourspot active frames adjusted, now activates 4 frames before main hitbox, and gets removed 3 frames after main hitbox gets removed. Can launch opponents into the main hitbox from behind so...be careful. |
| | | Final hit will degrade weapon durability by 7.5 (Forward and Back Air degrade by 6.5). If the current weapon is wood, weapon durability receives double degradation. |
| **Down Smash** | | Angle sends more upwards |
|  |  |  |
| **Forward Air** | | Damage reduced by 1.5% |
| **Back Air** | | Damage reduced by 1.5% |
| **Up Air** | | Frame Data and Animation now matches Up Tilt (increasing total frames). Note that this does not allow Steve to build a block below him to create UpTilt Ladder Combos as easily as before. |
| **Down Air** | | No longer stalls in the air when Anvil fails to spawn. |
| | | Damage is now based on distance traveled, which does mean a point-blank anvil won't kill until much later |
| | | Landing hitbox damage decreased |
|  |  |  |
| **Side Special** | | |
| **Minecart** | | Minecart's grab strength decreased |
| | | Powered Minecart knockback decreased |
| **Down Special** | | First explosion hitbox deals damage to Steve |

## Crafting Mechanics

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Crafting Table** | | Crafting Table will now received 1/4th hitstop from attacks, instead of 1/2th |
| | | Crafting Table can no longer be summoned with Iron |
| | | Crafting Table now requires more materials to summon (4->6 Stone, 2->4 Wood) |
| | | Upon breaking, Crafting Table cannot be respawned for 15 seconds |
| **Block durability** | | Wood and Stone blocks have 2% less HP |
| | | Blocks lose less HP over time |
| | | Blocks lose less HP over time when standing on the block |
