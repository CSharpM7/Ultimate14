# Overview 

Let's be honest, this is what you came here for. There might be quite a few changes here, but nothing that puts Steve out of the running for Top 5. The two biggest changes are to UpTilt and Weapon Hitboxes. UpTilt is made slower, so you can't just hold the A button. Its aerial counterpart acts more like its grounded variant, which means Up Tilt ladders end sooner. Weapon sourspots now no longer get upgraded alongside the current material. In practice, it won't change too much, but this does make it so Diamond Back Air's armpit hitbox won't kill until much later. Across the board, Steve has receieved slight damage reducations (apart from Up Smash which now acts like a high damaging ender). Minecart also cannot gimp as easily, as when airborne, minecart loses its grab hitbox. As a conselation prize, blocks now decay less when you stand on them, and they also decay less over time.


## Stats

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Weight** | | Reduced (92->83) |
|  | |  |

## Moveset

- For axe and pickaxe attacks, only the weapon's head uses the specific material hitboxes. The handles have the same properties as the wood variant. The handle hitbox sizes are often reduced, as that hitbox traditionally takes priority over the sweetspot
- Up Smash changes are experimental

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Jab / Forward Tilt / Neutral Air / Short Hop Forward Air / Short Hop Back Air** | | Durability degradation increased (2->3) |
| | | Base knockback increased |
| **Up Tilt / Up Air** | | Total frames increased (12->16 for gold, 16->22 for others). This adds 2 frames to startup. |
| | | Damage reduced by 1% |
|  |  |  |
| **Forward Air** | | Damage reduced by 1.25% |
| **Up Smash** | | Buckle up, cause this is gonna get REAL weird. |
| | | Players can now break the Magma block with a direct attack from frames 9 to 48. Doing so will make Steve skip to the mining animation of the attack, with no finishing hitbox. Steve will endure 18 recovery frames from this which leaves Steve slightly less open. |
| | | After the Magma block is unintentionally broken, a flinchless 6% hitbox will spawn for 2 frames, which will hurt players that don't use disjoints |
| | | Magma block doesn't interact with most other projectiles. |
| | | Final hit will degrade weapon durability by 7.5 (Forward and Back Air degrade by 6.5). If the current weapon is wood, weapon durability receives double degradation. If the current weapon is punch, Steve gets his little hand burnt :( |
| | | Final hit damage increased (14->16) |
| | | Final hit knockback reduced |
| | | Sourspot now exists when no pickaxe is equipped |
| | | Sourspot active frames adjusted, now activates 4 frames before main hitbox, and gets removed 3 frames after main hitbox gets removed. Can launch opponents into the main hitbox from behind so...becareful. |
| **Down Smash** | | Sends upwards instead of outwards |
|  |  |  |
| **Forward Air** | | Damage reduced by 1.5% |
| **Back Air** | | Damage reduced by 1.5% |
| **Up Air** | | Frame Data and Animation now matches Up Tilt (increasing total frames). Note that this does not allow Steve to build a block below him to create UpTilt Ladder Combos as easily as before. |
| **Down Air** | | No longer stalls in the air when Anvil fails to spawn. |
|  |  |  |
| **Side Special** | | Startup increased |
| **Minecart** | | Minecart's grab strength decreased |
| | | Powered Minecart knockback dealt decreased |
| | | Minecart cannot grab opponents when the minecart is airborne |
| **Down Special** | | First explosion hitbox deals damage to Steve |

## Crafting Mechanics

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Crafting Table** | | Crafting Table will now received 1/4th hitstop from attacks, instead of 1/2th |
| | | Crafting Table can no longer be summoned with Iron |
| | | Crafting Table now requires more materials to summon (4->6 Stone, 2->4 Wood) |
| **Block durability** | | Wood and Stone blocks have 2% less HP |
| | | Blocks loose less HP over time |
| | | Blocks loose less HP over time when standing on the block |
