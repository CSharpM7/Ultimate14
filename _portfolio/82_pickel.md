# Overview 

Let's be honest, this is what you came here for.

# Changes

- For axe and pickaxe attacks, only the weapon's head uses the specific material hitboxes. The handles have the same properties as the wood variant. The handle hitbox sizes are often reduced, as that hitbox traditionally takes priority over the sweetspot

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Up Tilt** | | Total frames increased (12->16 for gold, 16->22 for others). This adds 2 frames to startup. |
|  |  |  |
| **Up Smash** | | Buckle up, cause this is gonna get REAL weird. |
| | | Players can now break the Magma block with a direct attack from frames 9 to 48. Doing so will make Steve skip to the mining animation of the attack, with no finishing hitbox. Steve will endure 18 recovery frames from this, so strong aerials and rising aerials will still put Steve in a good spot, where as falling, sweeping aerials might put the opponent in advantage. |
| | | Final hit will degrade weapon durability by 7.5 (Forward and Back Air degrade by 6.5). If the current weapon is wood, weapon durability receives double degradation. If the current weapon is punch, Steve gets his little hand burnt :( |
| | | Final hit damage increased (14->16) |
| | | Final hit knockback reduced |
| | | Sourspot now exists when no pickaxe is equipped |
| | | Sourspot active frames adjusted, now activates 4 frames before main hitbox, and gets removed 3 frames after main hitbox gets removed. Can launch opponents into the main hitbox from behind so...becareful. |
|  |  |  |
| **Up Air** | | Frame Data and Animation now matches Up Tilt (increasing total frames). Note that this does not allow Steve to build a block below him to create UpTilt Ladder Combos as easily as before. |

# Crafting Mechanics

| **Crafting Table** | | Crafting Table will now received 1/4th hitstop from attacks, instead of 1/2th |
| | | Crafting Table can no longer be summoned with Iron |
| | | Crafting Table now requires more materials to summon (4->6 Stone, 2->4 Wood) |
