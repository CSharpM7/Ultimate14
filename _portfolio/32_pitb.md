# Overview 

Dark Pit and Dark Samus got similar changes respective to their characters: less multihits and more power. For Dark Pit though, it transforms him from Pit's intricate drag down aerial combo game to a hybrid of Cloud, Sephiroth and Mii Brawler. Use his aerials to finish opponents, and his nair to combo into most of his kit. Threaten the stage with his arrows or his single orbiter
