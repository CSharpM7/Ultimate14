# Overview 

Dark Pit and Dark Samus got similar changes respective to their characters: less multihits and more power. For Dark Pit though, it transforms him from Pit's intricate drag down aerial combo game to a hybrid of Cloud, Sephiroth and Mii Brawler. His nair now combos into most of his kit, which could lead into either up air or up special for a KO. He has two new specials, and one heavily modified one. Side Special can paralyze foes, drawing from the source material of the move. Up Special is a tried and true uppercut. Down Special only protects in front of Dark Pit, but has a hitbox of deactivation. Dark Pit is a new take on Pit's gameplan that sacrifices recovery for more potent knockout capability.
