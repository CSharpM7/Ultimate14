# Overview 

Dark Pit and Dark Samus got similar changes respective to their characters: less multihits and more power. For Dark Pit though, it transforms him from Pit's intricate drag down aerial combo game to more of a streamlined one like Lucina and Sephiroth. He has to be more precise with his aerials, but they often lead into guaranteed combos or put the enemy in disadvantage. He has a new special, and one heavily modified one. Side Special has a visual overhaul using his Staff instead. Functionally it's almost identical, trading a reflector for faster startup, larger detection, and a long hitbox on activation. Up Special is a tried and true uppercut, which takes away his immaculate recovery and gives him a devasting combo finisher. Dark Pit is a new take on Pit's gameplan that sacrifices recovery and lenient hitboxes for launch power.
