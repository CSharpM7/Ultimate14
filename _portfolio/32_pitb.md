# Overview 

Dark Pit is a bit more of a zoner than Pit is, sporting an incredible new recovery and projectile while losing some of the long-lasting aerials. Pit's intricate drag down aerial combo game has been more streamlined akin to Lucina and Sephiroth. He has to be more precise with his aerials, but they often lead into guaranteed combos or put the enemy in disadvantage. Summon Orbiter can let Dark Pit hide behind the advancing orbitor

| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Pit Changes** | | Dark Pit's Tilts, Neutral Air, Down Air share the same changes as Pit |
|  |  |  |
| **Forward Air** | | An overhead swing that covers more range, but doesn't last as long |
| **Up Air** | | The classic swordsman upair, launches foes further than before, but cannot drag down opponents. The later half of the move has a weaker hitbox that can be used to combo into moves at higher percents |

## Up Special (Power of Flight)

The return of the legendary Brawl recovery. Gifted with Pandora's Power, Dark Pit can take full control over how he flies. While the recovery is much slower than Pit's, Dark Pit can turn midair and attack with an aerial whenever he pleases! Similar to Rob, the Villagers, and Olimar: Dark Pit will need to recharge his power by first landing. If you get hit off stage with no fuel, it might just be over for you!

## Down Special (Summon Orbiter)

</video>

Similar to Palutena's Reflection Board, except it can only block physical attacks. Each attack will slightly slow it down, and it can only block a few physical attacks before breaking. The cooldown is much longer than Pit's, and will always enter cooldown after being used. Pick when to use this move wisely...or just use it offstage.
