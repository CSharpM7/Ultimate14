# Overview 

Dark Pit and Dark Samus got similar changes respective to their characters: less multihits and more power. For Dark Pit though, it transforms him from Pit's intricate drag down aerial combo game to more of a streamlined one like Lucina and Sephiroth. He has to be more precise with his aerials, but they often lead into guaranteed combos or put the enemy in disadvantage. He has a new special, and one heavily modified one. Side Special has a visual overhaul using his Staff instead. Functionally it's almost identical, trading a reflector for faster startup, larger detection, and a long hitbox on activation. Up Special is a tried and true uppercut, which takes away his immaculate recovery and gives him a devasting combo finisher. Dark Pit is a new take on Pit's gameplan that sacrifices recovery and lenient hitboxes for launch power.

# Tilts

His forward and up tilts received the same remedies Pit has

# Aerials

## Neutral Air

A two hit attack that sends opponents more upwards than before. While it deals less damage, it has less landing lag

## Forward Air

An overhead sword swing that covers more range than before, but at the cost of active frames. 

## Up Air

The classic swordsman upair, launches foes further than before, but cannot drag down opponents 

## Down Air

Visually identical, but the sweetspot has been increased (like Pit) and the sourspots now send horizontally 

# Specials

## Side Special (Staff Burst)

Can no longer reflect, has faster startup, and deals more damage
