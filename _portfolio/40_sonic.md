# Overview 

How does one balance the fastest thing alive while trying to keep his moveset interesting? The aim of this overhaul is to tone down his damage (his tilts are already a good example of this), remove some of his long-lasting hitboxes and disjoints, and reduce how mobile he while airborne. In exchange, Sonic gets more moves that can lead into combos and a stylish move that can be used both on and off stage for combos.

|  |  |  |

## Neutral Special (Blue Tornado)

A staple of Sonic's modern movesets has been generating a cyclone from his speed, so what better Neutral Special than Sonic Heroes' Blue Tornado attack? While this move takes a solid 18 frames to start up, this long lasting hitbox will keep enemies stuck in the eye of the tornado, until both Sonic and everyone are shot upwards, with Sonic having some advantage frames. In the air, this move starts a bit below Sonic and comes out 3 frames faster, which can be great after footstooling an opponent or trying to catch a recovery.

## Side Special (Homing Attack)

<video src="https://csharpm7.github.io/Ultimate14/assets/img/videos/sonic_specials.mp4" width="640" height="360" controls></video>

Similar in function to the original Homing Attack, this adjusted version can no longer be charged and only detects opponents in front of Sonic (or extremely close). While this move is heavily nerfed in terms of damage and losing the back air kill confirm, this move becomes a much better recovery tool when there's no opponents around, functioning more like his Air Dash / Homing Attack in his modern games. When homing in, Sonic will have a more linear trajectory towards his opponents, and will bounce above them instead of in front of them. This might leave Sonic more vulnerable on shield, but on hit this can lead into an aerial for extra damage.
