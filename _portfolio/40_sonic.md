# Overview 

How does one balance the fastest thing alive while trying to keep his moveset interesting? The aim of this overhaul is to tone down his damage (his tilts are already a good example of this), remove some of his long-lasting hitboxes and disjoints, and reduce how mobile he while airborne. In exchange, Sonic gets more moves that can lead into combos, a more refined Homing Attack that won't have sonic hurling towards the blastzone, and a stylish move that can be used both on and off stage for combos. He's still very much a top 10 character, but he might not be powerful enough to be considered the same tier as a character that can make stage collision wherever he wants...

# Changes

## Stats

Most of his stats have been reworked to be similar to other fast characters like Captain Falcon and Roy, which means his new "fast faller" nature will increase the rewards players get when they finally catch up to Sonic and land a hit.

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Dash Speed** | | Decreased to 2.0 (similar to Wolf)  |
| **Air Speed (X)** | | Decreased to 1.15 (similar to Mii Brawler)  |
| **Air Accel (Y)** | | Increased to 0.12 (similar to Captain Falcon) |
| **Fall Speed** | | Increased to 1.8 (similar to Roy)  |
| **Dive Speed** | | Decreased to 2.64 (similar to Mii Swordfighter)  |
| **Weight** | | Decreased to 80 (similar to Zero Suit Samus) |

|  |  |  |
| **Forward Smash** | | Damaged reduced to 13.0% |

|  |  | Deals 12.0% and 8.0%, does not hit below the ledge  |
|  |  |  |
| **Neutral Air** | | Animation cleaned up to have Sonic spin in place, while reducing some active frames. Functions more similarly to DeDeDe Nair than Wario Nair now |
|  |  | Removed final weak hitbox |
|  |  | Damage reduced to 8.0/6.0% |
|  |  | Angle decreased to 65 |
| **Forward Air** | | A two hit cyclone kick inspired by various GBA/DS moves, as well as Joker and Zero Suit Samus'. |

## Neutral Special (Blue Tornado)

A staple of Sonic's modern movesets has been generating a cyclone from his speed, so what better Neutral Special than Sonic Heroes' Blue Tornado attack? While this move takes a solid 18 frames to start up, this long lasting hitbox will keep enemies stuck in the eye of the tornado, until both Sonic and everyone are shot upwards, with Sonic having some advantage frames. In the air, this move starts a bit below Sonic and comes out 3 frames faster, which can be great after footstooling an opponent or trying to catch a recovery.

## Side Special (Homing Attack)

<video src="https://csharpm7.github.io/Ultimate14/assets/img/videos/sonic_specials.mp4" width="640" height="360" controls></video>

Similar in function to the original Homing Attack, this adjusted version can no longer be charged and only detects opponents in front of Sonic (or extremely close). While this move is heavily nerfed in terms of damage and losing the back air kill confirm, this move becomes a much better recovery tool when there's no opponents around, functioning more like his Air Dash / Homing Attack in his modern games. When homing in, Sonic will have a more linear trajectory towards his opponents, and will bounce above them instead of in front of them. This might leave Sonic more vulnerable on shield, but on hit this can lead into an aerial for extra damage.
