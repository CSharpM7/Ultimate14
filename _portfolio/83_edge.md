# Overview 

Sephiroth's main feature in Ultimate 14 is a slightly retooled Wing Mechanic. His base stats have been improved to be slightly closer to his original Winged stats, while his winged stats are closer to his new base stats. Wing now acts more like an extra defensive mechanic, rather than a true comeback mechanic, as the damage bonus has been reduced notably, but he now receives increased shield health.
