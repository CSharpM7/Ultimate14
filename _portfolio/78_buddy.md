# Overview

The character with the most changes to Ultimate 14, these changes help bring Banjo out of the "Smash 4" character design, and back into Ultimate. While there are a plethora of changes, there's a solid mix of buffs and nerfs. Buffs often help his subpar damage output, or add to his comboing capabilities. Nerfs often focus on the relatively low recovery frames Banjo has on his strongest attacks, or slightly nerfing his reversal options while trying to recover.
