# Overview

Ridley sits in a very unique spot in the 13 meta: he goes toe-to-toe with many top and high tiers, but suffers against those with multiple projectiles. These changes make the demon in the skies much more threatening in the air, while dampening some of the chaotic power of his smash attacks.
