# Overview 

An echo of an echo? Similar to Lucina, Chrom is already a very solid echo fighter, save for his notoriously subpar recovery. These changes help remedy some of Chrom's recovery, making it a little bit in tune with Roy. Chrom also has had applied the various Fire Emblem balance changes.

# Changes

## Parallel Falchion Nerf
All normals, neutral special, and side special deal 0.9x damage

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Dash Attack** | | Damage increased (12->12.75) |
|  |  |  |
| **Forward Smash** | | Damage decreased (18->16.5) |
|  |  |  |
| **Up Air** | | Active Frames decreased by 2 |
|  |  | Landing Lag increased by 1 |
| **Down Air** | | Sweetspot adjusted to be lower, making it resemble the sword rather than the hilt (like Roy has) |
| | | |
| **Up Special** | | A slightly redesigned Soaring Tempest that allows Chrom to recover more reliably. Pressing Up Special will have Chrom do an armored super jump, where he's free to grab the ledge. If you hold Special during the jump, he will transition into Aether, spinning down towards the stage (or blastzone). The spin deals moderate damage and knockback |
