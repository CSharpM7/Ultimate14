# Overview 

An echo of an echo?!? Similar to Lucina, Chrom is already a very solid echo fighter, save for his notoriously subpar recovery. These changes help remedy some of Chrom's recovery, making it a little bit in tune with Roy. Chrom also has had applied the various Fire Emblem balance changes.

# Changes

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Dash Attack** | | Damage increased (12->12.75) |
|  |  |  |
| **Forward Smash** | | Damage decreased (18->16.5) |
| **Up Smash** | | A new upwards swinging attack that has a few more startup frames |
|  |  |  |
| **Up Air** | | Active Frames decreased by 1 |
|  |  | Landing Lag increased by 1 |
| **Down Air** | | Sweetspot adjusted to be lower, making it resemble the sword rather than the hilt (like Roy has) |
| | | |
| **Side Special 4 Upwards:** | | Decreased knockback |
| | | Can cancel 10 frames earlier on hit |
| **Up Special** | | A slightly redesigned Soaring Tempest that allows Chrom to recover more reliably, but sacrifices its advantage as an out of shield option |
| **Rising Tempest:** | | If an opponent is not hit, or the special button is not held within 10 frames, Chrom will simply jump upwards  |
|  | | Chrom can grab the ledge during the upward ascent, but only for a few frames |
| **Vengeful Tempest:** | | On hit, Chrom will perform the move like normal, but at the end, Chrom will no longer descend into the abyss, instead performing a short hop |
| | | Opponents still get sent downward, but at lower percents this puts Chrom at a rather unfavorable position |
