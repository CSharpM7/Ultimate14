# Overview 

One of the echoes that received a decent amount of changes, Dark Samus now acts more like a glass cannon in a similar manner to Mewtwo: strong hits but doesn't take hits well. It's recovery might be shot without a wall jump or bombs, but Screw Attack can be used multiple times in the air. The main changes involve converting most multihits into single hits, more mobility, and less survivability. It has increased air and ground speed, but much less weight, turning from defensive powerhouse to more of an aggro character that can control space. Its nair is a decent combo starter, while its fair is a powerful finisher. For specials, Dark Samus trades the iconic Charge Shot for the Hyperbeam. When fully charged, it covers a large, but narrow distance in front. Dark Samus only has access to the Hyper Missile. Hyper Missiles are like Samus's super missile, but stronger. They do leave Dark Samus more vulnerable, though. 

Screw Attack is more akin to source material. While it can't KO, you won't be put into a helpless state after using this, so you can recover similar to Bayonetta. Hyperball finally lets Metroid Crawl! However, this guts Dark Samus's easy ledge trapping and stalling powers in favor of a nasty combo starter

# Jab

# Dash Attack 

Dash Attack is now much weaker, but can be cancelled sooner

# Smash Attacks

# Aerials

## Nair

Nair is now speed up, and sends at a different angle

## Fair

A powerful punch that has longer startup, but increased launch power. this move is also no longer a multihit 

## Bair

see samus

## Upair

Upair starts a little later, but the move launches foes higher now 

# Specials

## Neutral Special (Hyper Beam)

Neutral Special takes 5 seconds to fully charge up. The uncharged version sends out a fixed damage Phazon Ball akin to Charge Shot, but is faster. The fully charged version sends a laser that covers a large area that performs multiple hits, and then launches opponents. It deals more damage than Charge Shot, but due to its relatively low knockback, will KO much later. During the beam shot, Dark Samus has super armor. The laser can be absorbed and reflected, but Dark Samus will often not take the full damage

## Side Special (Hyper Missile)

can only shoot one type of missile 

## Up Special 

no longer sends into free fall

## Down Special
