# Overview 

One of the echoes that received the most amount of changes, Dark Samus now acts more like a glass cannon in a similar manner to Mewtwo: strong hits but doesn't take hits well. It has increased air and ground speed, but much less weight, turning from defensive powerhouse to more of an aggro character that can control space. If you ever felt like you wanted a more aggressive version of Samus, this might be the character for you! The signature charge shot has been replaced with a mechanic similar to Limit/Arsene/Deep Breathing called Corruption. Corruption allows you to poison opponents with normals, and end combos with a devastating explosion. Its main drawback is that it does deal damage to Dark Samus while active.

|  |  |  |
| **Forward Smash** | | Increased range on sweetspot, slightly increased knockback |
| **Up Smash** | | Dark Samus uses the split kick from one of its victory poses. Moves Dark Samus backwards |
|  |  |  |
| **Nair Air** | | A new, singlehit screw attack |
| **Forward Air** | | A powerful Phazon punch that has increased startup, but increased knockback. This move is a single hit. |

## Neutral Special: Phazon Charge and Phazon Discharge, Corruption

Similar to Samus's charge-based gameplan, Dark Samus can charge Phazon while holding neutral special. Getting hit during this charge, or interupting it with the Discharge attack will remove your current charge. After the charge is complete, Dark Samus will enter Corruption. Dark Samus take small damage overtime due to over corruption, but Down Tilt, Forward Smash, Forward Air, Up Air, and Up Throw will deal poison to opponents on hit. While in Corruption, neutral special becomes a powerful explosion that gets rid of all Phazon. How much Phazon remains determines the power of this move.

## Side Special: Hyper Missile

Can only shoot the Hyper Missile, which uses the same recovery frames and animation as shooting a Super Missile does. Hyper Missiles have less homing sensitivity, but move faster. The missile deals two hits: the first deals strong knockback and the following explosion deals minor, flinchless damage over time.

## Up Special: Hyper Shinespark

Similar to Ridley's Wing Blitz, this move doesn't have a startup hitbox, but does have a strong, singlehit launcher on movement. Unlike Wing Blitz, Dark Samus can angle this in any direction.

## Down Special: Hyper Bomb

Dark Samus imbues the Hyperball technique into a single bomb. This bomb deals minor, repeating, flinchless damage around the area it is placed. After the fuse goes off, opponents are sent upward.
