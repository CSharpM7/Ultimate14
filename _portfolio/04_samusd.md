# Overview 

One of the echoes that received a decent amount of changes, Dark Samus now acts more like a glass cannon in a similar manner to Mewtwo: strong hits but doesn't take hits well. It's recovery might be shot without a wall jump or bombs, but Screw Attack can be used multiple times in the air. The main changes involve converting most multihits into single hits, more mobility, and less survivability. It has increased air and ground speed, but much less weight, turning from defensive powerhouse to more of an aggro character that can control space. Its nair is a decent combo starter, while its fair is a powerful finisher. For specials, Dark Samus trades the iconic Charge Shot for the Hyperbeam. When fully charged, it covers a large, but narrow distance in front. Dark Samus only has access to the Hyper Missile. Hyper Missiles are like Samus's super missile, but stronger. They do leave Dark Samus more vulnerable, though. 

Screw Attack is more akin to source material. While it can't KO, you won't be put into a helpless state after using this, so you can recover similar to Bayonetta. Hyperball finally lets Metroid Crawl! However, this guts Dark Samus's easy ledge trapping and stalling powers in favor of a nasty combo starter

# New Specials

## Neutral Special: Hyper Beam

Neutral Special takes 8 seconds to fully charge up. The uncharged version sends out a fixed damage Phazon Ball akin to Charge Shot, but is faster. The fully charged version sends a paralyzing laser that covers a long, but narrow range. It deals more damage than Charge Shot at close range, with further ranges dealing weaker damage. During the beam shot, Dark Samus has heavy armor. The laser can be absorbed and reflected, reflecting this move up close might just kill Dark Samus at 0%.

## Side Special: Hyper Missile

Can only shoot the Hyper Missile, which uses the same recovery frames and animation as shooting a Super Missile does. Hyper Missiles have less homing sensitivity, but move faster. The explosion deals increased damage and has increased range.

## Up Special: Hyper Screw Attack

While not actually a move from Metroid Prime 3, this version of screw attack no longer sends into free fall after use, so Dark Samus' recovery is more akin to Bayonetta...if Bayonetta also had a tether. The final hit does not kill.

## Down Special: Hyperball

An unorthodox take on the classic "Shine" attack, Dark Samus transforms into a ball and can crawl across the floor. The move's constant attack hitbox starts on frame 25, this attack hitbox has decent range but deals no hitstun. Dark Samus can also jump on the ground during the crawl phase, or use shield to cancel the move. Pressing Attack or Special after frame 32 will activate the "shine", a slightly larger attack that pops opponents upwards and cancels the move. There's very little recovery frames after popping the shine, so this can be used to combo into several aerials, as well as Up Tilt and Up Smash at lower percents.
