# Overview 

One of the echoes that received a decent amount of changes, Dark Samus now acts more like a glass cannon in a similar manner to Mewtwo: strong hits but doesn't take hits well. The main changes involve converting most multihits into single hits, more mobility, and less survivability. Dark Samus has access to a slightly more limited arsenal than Samus, but its normals help chain into a finishing blow a lot smoother.
