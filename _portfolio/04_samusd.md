# Overview 

One of the echoes that received a decent amount of changes, Dark Samus now acts more like a glass cannon in a similar manner to Mewtwo: strong hits but doesn't take hits well. It's recovery might be shot without a wall jump, bomb jump, or a long grapple, but Screw Attack can be used multiple times in the air. The main changes involve converting most multihits into single hits, more mobility, and less survivability. It has increased air and ground speed, but much less weight, turning from defensive powerhouse to more of an aggro character that can control space. Her nair and fair are more geared towards comboing, which could help finding a charge shot KO. Speaking of specials, Dark Samus only has access to the Hyper Missile. Hyper Missiles are like Samus's super missile, but stronger. They do leave Dark Samus more vulnerable, though. 
Dark Samus. Shinespark is now Screw Attack, while it can't KO, you won't be put into a helpless state after using this, so you can recover similar to Bayonetta. Hyperball finally lets Metroid Crawl! However, this guts Daek Samus's easy ledge trapping and stalling powers.
