# Overview 

One of the echoes that received the most amount of changes, Dark Samus now acts more like a glass cannon in a similar manner to Mewtwo: strong hits but doesn't take hits well. It has increased air and ground speed, but much less weight, turning from defensive powerhouse to more of an aggro character that can control space. If you ever felt like you wanted a more aggressive version of Samus, this might be the character for you! The signature charge shot has been replaced with a mechanic similar to Limit/Arsene/Deep Breathing called Corruption. Corruption allows you to poison opponents with normals, and end combos with a devastating explosion. Its main drawback is that it does deal damage to Dark Samus while active.

## Neutral Special: Phazon Charge / Discharge

Similar to Samus's charge-based gameplan, Dark Samus can charge Phazon while holding neutral special. After the charge is complete, Dark Samus will enter Corruption. Dark Samus take small damage overtime due to over corruption, but Forward Smash, Down Smash, Forward Air, Down Air, Side Special, Down Special and Up Throw will deal poison to opponents on hit. While in Corruption, neutral special becomes a powerful explosion that gets rid of all Phazon. How much Phazon remains determines the power of this move.

## Side Special: Hyper Missile

Can only shoot the Hyper Missile, which uses the same recovery frames and animation as shooting a Super Missile does. Hyper Missiles have less homing sensitivity, but move faster. The explosion deals increased damage and has increased range.

## Up Special: Hyper Shinespark

Similar to Fire Fox, this move doesn't have a startup hitbox, but does have a strong, singlehit launcher on movement. This move also doesn't go extremely far, but uniquely has fast startup for a Fire Fox type move.

## Down Special: Hyper Bomb

Dark Samus imbues the Hyperball technique into a single bomb. This bomb deals minor, repeating, flinchless damage around the area it is placed. After the fuse goes off, opponents are sent upward.
