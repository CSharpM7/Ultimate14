# Overview 

It is every mod's right of passage to change Ganondorf's moveset, and there's no shortage of changes here. Ultimate 14 Ganondorf is a hybrid sword-fighter and brawler, similar to Ridley. His new normals increase his range, while his new specials help improve his recovery. Agility is still his main flaw, but now his jump height is increased to help improve his combo game. For 3 games in a row, Ganondorf has been one of the worst in the game but now, at least he's a commendable low-mid tier. 

# Changes

## Stats

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Jump Height (Ground)** | | Increased to 30 (similar to Simon)  |
| **Jump Height (Aerial)** | | Increased to 28 (similar to Roy)  |

## Moveset

| |  |  |
| :----------- | :-----: | ----------- |
| **Jab** | | His old F-Tilt, now sporting similar frame data and damage to his original jab. |
| | | |
| **Ftilt Tilt** | | A simple sword swing that moves Ganondorf forward and comes out frame 14. This move cannot be angled, but covers a decent range below and in front of Ganondorf. |
| | | |
| **Up Tilt** | | An upwards up with the hilt of his sword. Decent for comboing into aerials, and has very low recovery frames |
| | | |
| **Back Air** | | Swings his sword behind him. This turns Ganondorf around similar to Marth. Has fast startup for how powerful this move is |
| | | |
| **Forward Throw** | | Now uses his old Forward Smash animation while keeping the same frame data and damage as his original Forwad Throw |
| | | |
| **Side Special (Air)** | | Upon grabbing an enemy, Ganondorf will transition into his old Up Special grab. No longer will Ganondorf and his opponent plunge towards the blastzone, though this does remove tech chasing from the Aerial version |
| | | No longer goes into freefall from a failed Side Special, however Side Special can only be used once per airtime |

## Up Special (Float)

It's not a real mod if Ganondorf doesn't have a float! Similar to Dark Pit, Ganondorf can cancel this move with aerials at any point after rising. Unlike Dark Pit, Ganondorf will not turn around in the air during his float. Cancelling it the frame you rise into the air gives you a Super Jump! His float only lasts for 2 seconds, and you will need to land to start recharging your fuel. Becareful about getting hit during this move while offstage!
