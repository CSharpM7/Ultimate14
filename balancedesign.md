# Overview
These are the guides that are used

# Mechanics and General Changes

- Apart from winged characters getting in aerial movement buff, most movement stats should remain the same 
- Only one, maybe two movement mechanics should be added
- Mechanics and features that have been covered in a direct should not be altered (rip removing the 0.8x macro multiplier)
- Low tiers shall not become high tiers, high tiers shall not become low tiers. Balancing should be done in such a manner that characters shift only a tier up, down or not at all (unless said tier placing is solely based on abusing toxic mechanics / moves (ie EWGF and Arms)
- It's okay for characters to be bad
- Echos can be differentiated, but no moves shall be made (sorry dark samus and richter)

# Move Changes

- Absolutely NO new moves should be added
- Additional animations should only be included if extremely necessary
- Moves that couldn't kill before shouldn't suddenly kill now; moves that killed before can be changed to kill much later, however 
- Moves' special properties covered in direct should not be altered excessively…except EWGF
- Very few moves should be retooled (ie how raptor boost was one of the few to receive this)
- Jab 1s should all have the ability to jab lock
- Multihit aerials should be as consistent as possible
- Drag-down nairs should be consistent in hitboxes, using either Palu or Mythra as a base. This should entail attaching bones to arm/wing/leaf/weapon joints instead of the top joint…of the top joint should consist of one large hitbox…which isn't ideal
- Landing hitboxes from drag-down nairs should be consistent across the cast
- Landing hitboxes should not appear if landing before/after the main hitboxes are active
- Fairs should not have landing hitboxes 
- Defensive OoS moves need their KO power and/or range toned down across the cast
- Zoners will not have multiple kill throws that kill below 200%
- Zoners should not have phenominal OoS options
- Moves with armor or other skewed risk/reward should have KO power toned down
- ToDs should be toned down. 0-Deaths should be remedied if possible
