# Overview
These are the guides that are used

# Mechanics and General Changes

- Winged characters get an aerial movement buff
- Most characters will get some sort of recovery nerf to speed up the flow of the game
- Only one, maybe two movement mechanics should be added
- Mechanics and features that have been covered in a direct should not be altered (rip removing the 0.8x macro multiplier)
- Low tiers shall not become high tiers, high tiers shall not become low tiers. Balancing should be done in such a manner that characters shift tiers within adjacent ranges
- It's okay for characters to be bad

# Move Changes

- Absolutely NO* new moves should be added on non-cloned characters (excludes clones,semiclones, echoes, and Aegis)
- *Some exceptions like Sonic who needs to more moves that aren't just "ball", and Marth/Lucina/Chrom/Roy/Ike/Corrin and Link/Young Link/Toon Link who could use some further distinction 
- Moves that couldn't kill before shouldn't suddenly kill now; moves that killed before can be changed to kill much later, however 
- Moves' special properties covered in a nintendo direct / sakurai presents should not be altered excessively…except EWGF and GO!
- Very few moves should be retooled (ie how raptor boost was one of the few to receive this)
- Jab 1s should all have the ability to jab lock
- Drag-down nairs should be consistent in hitboxes, using either Palu or Mythra as a base. This should entail attaching bones to arm/wing/leaf/weapon joints instead of the top joint…or the top joint should consist of one large hitbox…which isn't ideal
- Landing hitboxes from drag-down nairs should be consistent across the cast
- Defensive OoS moves need their KO power and/or range toned down across the cast
- Zoners should not have phenominal reversals
- Moves with armor or other skewed risk/reward should have KO power toned down
- 0-Deaths should be harder to perform
